# Space Invaders

A Java project made using the libGDX framework.

The purpose of this project was to teach myself the basics of Java by developing a simple game containing multiple classes, inheritance and function overriding.

The game itself allows players to move left and right with A/D keys and shoot with Spacebar. You gain points by shooting the aliens coming towards you and you lose when they reach you. Every time you clear a wave the aliens get slightly faster making the difficulty ramp up over time.
